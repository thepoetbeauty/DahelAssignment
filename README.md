## Introduction
My name is Oyindamola Olaoluwa Daramola, I am from Lagos, Nigeria and I have a passion for Nursing. I applied to study Nursing at your prestigious university because I have always been intrigued by the nuances of Nursing, the way at which patients are being cared for and how the Nurses interact with their patient is enough to spike one's interest in becoming a Nurse.
My first degree background in Environmental Biology and Fisheries wasnâ€™t a course I wanted to do; I have always had the passion to study Nursing but I was too scared to actually pursue what I wanted because I was scared of failing. 
It took me five years to finally pursue what I truly desire to study and after I was done with school, I mastered the courage to finally go for what I wanted and decided to go for a Health care training and take some courses online. 
My decision to undergo Nursing at your prestigious university was not a mistake, your university is a dynamic institution with a long and vibrant history of improving people's lives through education, also rich in diversity and commitment to excellence learning, teaching the students experience which are qualities I believe will help me become a stellar student.  
I have always been directly or indirectly involved in Nursing, I have two Doctors and a Nurse in my family which has also fueled my interest in becoming a Nurse. I love treating and interacting with patients as have been to the hospitals and I have seen how the Nurses treat and interacts with their patients.
